You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  
* What new skills have you learned?
* What has been easy?
* What has been difficult?
* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?



* New skills: So far I really haven't learned anything new, but just reinforced and consolidated what I knew already. Reviewing material I know just makes it all the more easier to use.
* Easy: The assignment was straight-forward so it was easy to complete. 
* Difficult: I wasn't sure whether I should use <s> or <del> for the strikeout. I didn't think either of those tags captured the meaning of the strikeout. It seemed to be a strikeout for comic effect, but I didn't think either of those tags captured that intent. 
* Problem solving strategies: I really didn't need to deploy any problem solving strategies for this project.
